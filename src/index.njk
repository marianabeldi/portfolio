        <h1 class="section-title">Welcome to my blog!</h1>
        <p>Iâ€™ve been working in design and tech since 2005. I hold a degree in Graphic Design from the Universidad de Buenos Aires and a postgraduate degree in Branding, complemented by studies in Arts and Advertising.</p>
        <p>I'm a self-taught front-end developer with a focus on accessibility. In my free time, I create open-source SVG tools for developers and designers under the name HolaSVG. My writing on design and code has been featured in <a href="https://css-tricks.com/author/marianabeldi/">CSS-Tricks</a>, <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/author/mariana-beldi/">Smashing Magazine</a>, <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/search?q=Mariana+beldi">UX Collective</a>, and <a href="https://medium.muz.li/search?q=mariana+beldi">Muzli</a>, among others.</p>
        <p>Most of my work involves creating visual identities and developing digital products, from concept and strategy to fully realized projects</p>

      <ul>
        <li>+ I was born on the same day as my brother (but two years apart) in Buenos Aires, Argentina. We have a music band together.</li>
        <li>+ I have family in Italy, which gives me the perfect excuse to indulge in the best ice cream once a year.</li>
        <li>+ I studied at one of the top universities in Latin America and occasionally participate as a guest reviewer, providing feedback to UX postgraduate students on their final projects.</li>
        <li>+ One of the most challenging experiences I've had was traveling solo to India and Nepal for four months. During that time, I survived an earthquake, trekked in the mountains for 10 days, and completed a 10-day silent retreat.</li>
        <li>+ Before merging my passion for art with my daily work, I used to sell drawings and participate in contests and art exhibitions.</li>
        <li>+ I've been playing field hockey since I was 8 years old.</li>
        <li>+ One of my favorite trips was in 2023, living in a van and driving roughly 5,000 km over two weeks.</li>
        <li>+ My godson changed my life.</li>
