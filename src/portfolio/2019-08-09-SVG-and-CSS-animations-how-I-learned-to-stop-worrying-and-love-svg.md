In this talk, I'm covering the benefits of SVG, how to code basic shapes from scratch (including some commands for paths), explore the main attributes, optimize the files from Illustrator to the text editor, and how to repeat content with the use element. There are also case studies of animations with SASS and CSS and how to apply all these tools for better UX. It includes live coding and a few examples of the million things you can do by combining these languages.

SVG has been around since the late ’90s, but it was ignored by many until 2017 when it came back in full swing. This vector image format fulfills all we need in today’s modern web: scalability, responsiveness, interactivity, programmability, and accessibility.
