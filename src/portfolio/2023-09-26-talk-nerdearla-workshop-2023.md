In this workshop, we will explore the possibilities of the GreenSock Animation Platform (GSAP), one of the most popular JavaScript animation libraries today. GSAP offers a wide range of plugins and tools that make it easy to create complex animations and advanced effects. We will focus on using the ScrollTrigger plugin, a GSAP extension designed to synchronize animations with page scrolling. Youâ€™ll learn how to work with HTML, CSS, and SVG using GreenSock and discover how to control the timing and interactivity of animations in your projects.
