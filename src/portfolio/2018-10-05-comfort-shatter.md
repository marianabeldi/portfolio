## UI/UX design for mobile app prototype

> “Most people live in a restricted circle of potential.”  
> -William James

## Who is the app for?
Our mobile devices have become an indispensable part of our lives: we carry them everywhere we go, so why not use them for a bit of life coaching? Comfort Shatter is for people who want to improve their personal growth and development; the daily challenges create a positive feedback loop that can help with happiness and fulfillment.

### Proposal
Comfort Shatter is an app that brings users challenges to break out of their comfort zone. It offers different packages and dares to face social fears, improve self-esteem, and challenge the limits. It allows users to track their own progress, invite friends, and share their daily wins on social networks.

### Wireframes
Starting with some sketches. get the ideas out of the head and down on paper.

Montserrat as the main font for legibility across the site and VTS Supermarket sale for outstanding titles. Using round shapes and circles for a friendly look and feel.
