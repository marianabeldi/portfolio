Layouts are invisible structures that help us organize information within a site to assertively and visually show what we want to communicate.
Thanks to these structures we can improve the usability and readability of a site, as well as provide identity and originality.

In this episode of CSS Workshops, I'll show the way in which browsers organize elements within a page, to understand the fundamentals of web design. We will review the box model as a starting point, to understand the minimum structure of each HTML element and then we will review some display, position, floats and shape outside values ​​as resources to break the structure and compose more dynamic and varied layouts.
